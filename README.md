# Fastai Image Classifier 
Data science project example using deep learning for image classification 

## Overview 
For this example project I built an animal classifier to identify Foxes, Wolves and Bears. This is useful in detecting wild animals in arears prone to animal attacks so as to serve as a warning system.

## Config
I recommend using google colab for this project as it makes the gpu configuration far easier. In google colab make sure that you go to runtime -> change runtime type -> gpu. 

In colab, running the code should create the folder structure that you need. Drag and drop the photos located [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12cDnAIntmAYZ2lXXyeOa_GWdU926FYLU) into their respective folders. Technically you could skip the the folder creation and just drag and drop the data from the google drive into the colab file destination

## Data 
I used the following chrome extension to download the data from google images. [FatKun Batch Download Image](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en)
